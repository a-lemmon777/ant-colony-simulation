This document is installation document for computer simulation 
developed by Aleksejs Belezjaks for University of Hull 08341 Final Project 13/14.


// System Requirements //
	.NET Framework 4.0
	Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable

// Simulation controls //
You can change various simulation parameters during execution to see effect in real time. 
This is list of simulation parameters you can change in real time.

// Configuration file //
Instead of changing all parameters in real-time, you can put them into configuration file 
and feed it to program on start-up. You can find example configuration file in the same folder 
as executable file. You can find description of all parameters in this file.

For simulation to use your configuration file you have to pass it as command line argument. 
For this you have to create shortcut for executable and inside target text box add name 
of your configuration file. Example “C:\FinalProject.exe input.xml”.
