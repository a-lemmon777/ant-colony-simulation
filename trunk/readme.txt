This source has been tested and build on Visual Studio 2012 on both Windows 7 and Windows 8.

However, as project uses several 3rd party libraries it is possible that source might not build under other Visual Studio versions.

If you experience such problem you might to use Visual Studio 2012, or you have to rebuild all libraries inside your version of visual studio. This promary being GXBase (and maybe AntTweakBar).
